## Advanced Usage

Wireshark enables advanced network traffic analysis, which is essential for diagnosing complex network issues and understanding detailed protocol behavior. Below are examples of how to dissect specific types of network traffic, such as FTP and SMTP.

### Analyzing FTP Traffic

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard protocol used for transferring files over a network. Wireshark allows detailed inspection of FTP traffic, revealing information such as command sequences, file transfers, and authentication details.

1. **FTP Dissector**:

   ```sh
   ftp.request.command
   ```

   This filter displays any commands sent across the FTP control channel (typically port 21). FTP commands include operations like `USER` (to specify the username) and `PASS` (to submit the password). Analyzing these commands can reveal user credentials and requested filenames.

   - **Example Use Case**: If you suspect unauthorized access, filtering for `ftp.request.command` can help identify suspicious login attempts or file transfers.

2. **FTP-Request-Command Filter**:

   ```sh
   ftp.request.command && ftp-data
   ```

   This filter captures both control and data channels of FTP. The control channel handles commands and responses, while the data channel (typically port 20) carries the actual file content. Filtering for both can give a complete picture of an FTP session, including which files were transferred and under what circumstances.

   - **Example Use Case**: During a security audit, you may need to verify whether sensitive files were transferred unencrypted. This filter helps correlate the commands with the data being transferred.

### Analyzing SMTP Traffic

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a widely used protocol for email communication. Analyzing SMTP traffic can provide valuable insights during a penetration test or incident response scenario.

1. **Capturing SMTP Traffic**:

   ```sh
   smtp
   ```

   This display filter captures and inspects all SMTP-related traffic, including email messages, commands, and responses.

   - **Purpose**: By using this filter, you can monitor all SMTP traffic passing through your network, which may include critical information such as email addresses, message contents, and server responses.

2. **Extracting Email Messages**:

   ```sh
   tcp.port == 25 or tcp.port == 587
   ```

   This filter targets the standard SMTP ports (25 and 587) and helps locate and extract email messages from the captured traffic.

   - **Purpose**: Filtering based on these ports allows you to focus on the specific traffic where email data is transmitted, making it easier to extract and analyze email contents.

3. **Analyzing SMTP Commands and Responses**:

   ```sh
   smtp.command && smtp.response
   ```

   These filters allow you to focus on the SMTP commands sent by clients and the corresponding responses from the server.

   - **Purpose**: This type of analysis is useful for understanding the sequence of interactions between an email client and server, which can reveal potential misconfigurations, unauthorized access attempts, or the transmission of sensitive information.

   ![SMTP Commands and Responses Screenshot](smtp-commands-responses.png)
   _This screenshot shows the SMTP commands and responses captured and analyzed using the `smtp.command` and `smtp.response` filters._

   - **Example Use Case**: During an incident response, analyzing SMTP traffic may reveal attempts to exfiltrate sensitive data through email or identify phishing attempts targeting the organization.

## Wireless Network Analysis with Wireshark

Wireshark is not limited to just wired network analysis - it can also be a powerful tool for investigating wireless network traffic. This capability can be especially valuable for penetration testers looking to assess the security of wireless infrastructures.

### Capturing Wireless Traffic

Wireshark can capture wireless network traffic by using a wireless network interface in monitor mode. This allows you to see all the wireless frames, even those not destined for your own device.

**Command:**
```sh
wireshark -i wlan0 mon
```
This command starts Wireshark and captures wireless traffic on the `wlan0` interface in monitor mode.

## Tcpdump for Penetration Testers

Tcpdump is a command-line packet analyzer that serves as an alternative to Wireshark for capturing and analyzing network traffic. It is especially useful in environments where GUI tools are not available.

### Capturing Network Traffic with Tcpdump

**Basic Capture Command**:
```sh
tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap
```
This command captures all traffic on the `eth0` interface and writes it to a file named `capture.pcap` for later analysis.

- **Purpose**: Tcpdump allows for quick captures of network traffic, which can be imported into Wireshark for detailed analysis.

### Filtering Specific Traffic

**Filter by Port**:
```sh
tcpdump -i eth0 port 80
```
This command captures all traffic on a specific port, useful for monitoring services like HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443).
