## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, online privacy and cybersecurity are top priorities. Securing your network is essential. Pi-hole, a network-wide ad blocker, acts as a DNS sinkhole to intercept unwanted content and tracking scripts. Deploying Pi-hole on Ubuntu, known for its stability and popularity, offers an efficient solution to enhance network performance and privacy. This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to set up Pi-hole on Ubuntu, leveraging it as a DNS server for ad blocking and improved network control.

## What is DNS?

“ DNS is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.” — Cloudflare.

## Why Pi-hole?

Pi-hole serves as a DNS server with added benefits: it blocks requests to ad servers and malicious domains at the DNS level. This reduces unwanted content and potential threats, speeding up browsing by decreasing data load. Pi-hole offers a customizable admin interface for managing blocklists and privacy settings, making it suitable for both advanced users and beginners.
