## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This guide is tailored for cybersecurity professionals, focusing on advanced techniques to detect and mitigate cyber threats, emphasizing lesser-known facets of cybersecurity. By mastering these techniques, you can strengthen your organization's defense against sophisticated attacks.

## Pass-the-Hash Detection <a name="pass-the-hash-detection"></a>

**Pass-the-Hash** is an attack where adversaries use a user's NTLM hash to authenticate to systems without the plaintext password, exploiting Windows' hash storage in memory.

### Attack Overview
- **Extraction**: Attackers use tools like Mimikatz with admin privileges to extract NTLM hashes from memory.
- **Authentication**: The NTLM hash allows attackers to impersonate users, accessing systems and resources.
- **Lateral Movement**: Attackers move within the network, accessing unauthorized systems.

### Windows Access Tokens & Alternate Credentials
- **Access Tokens**: Define a process's security context, containing user identity and privileges.
- **Alternate Credentials**: Allow executing actions with different credentials using the `runas` command.

### Detection Opportunities
- **Event Logs**: Look for Event ID 4624 and LogonType 9 in Windows Event Log for `runas` command executions.
- **Sysmon**: Correlate User Logon with NewCredentials events and Sysmon Process Access Event Code 10 for enhanced detection.

### Splunk Detection
Use Splunk to identify Pass-the-Hash with specific searches targeting logon events and LSASS memory access.

#### Splunk Search Example
```spl
index=main EventCode=4624 Logon_Type=9 Logon_Process=seclogo
| table _time, ComputerName, user, Network_Account_Domain, Network_Account_Name
```

## HTTP Exfiltration Detection <a name="http-exfiltration-detection"></a>

**HTTP Exfiltration** is a stealthy technique where attackers send sensitive data to a C2 server using HTTP POST requests, often blending in with normal web traffic.

### Detection Approach
- **Network Monitoring**: Use tools to track data sent to specific IPs/ports, looking for large or frequent transfers.
- **Splunk & Zeek Logs**: Analyze logs to spot exfiltration patterns.

#### Splunk Search Example
```spl
index="cobaltstrike_exfiltration_http" sourcetype="bro:http:json" method=POST
| stats sum(request_body_len) as TotalBytes by src, dest, dest_port
| eval TotalBytes = TotalBytes/1024/1024
```

## Nmap Port Scanning Detection <a name="nmap-port-scanning-detection"></a>

**Nmap Port Scanning** is a common technique used by attackers and penetration testers to identify open ports on networked systems, akin to finding unlocked doors in a building.

### Scanning Process
- **TCP Handshake**: Nmap attempts to establish a TCP handshake with each port to check if it's open.
- **Banner Grabbing**: Connecting to an open port may reveal service information through a banner.

### Splunk & Zeek Logs for Detection
- **Splunk Interface**: Accessible at `https://[Target IP]:8000` for executing searches.
- **RDP Access**: Use `xfreerdp` to connect to the target system for file and log analysis.

#### Splunk Search Example
```spl
index="cobaltstrike_beacon" sourcetype="bro:conn:json" orig_bytes=0
| bin span=5m _time 
| stats dc(dest_port) by _time, src_ip, dest_ip 
| where num_dest_port >= 3
```
