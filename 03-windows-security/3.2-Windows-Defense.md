## Mastering Windows Event Logs <a name="mastering-windows-event-logs"></a>

This section dives deeper into advanced analysis techniques and less-known Event IDs that provide crucial insights.

### Advanced Security Log Analysis

- **Event ID 4688: Process Creation**
  - **Technique**: Create a baseline of normal process activities and use statistical analysis to detect anomalies.
  - **PowerShell Script for Anomaly Detection**:
    ```powershell
    Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security';ID=4688} | 
    Group-Object -Property {$_.Properties[5].Value} | 
    Where-Object {$_.Count -lt 5} | 
    Select-Object Name, Count
    ```

- **Event ID 5156: Windows Filtering Platform Connection Permitted**
  - **Usage**: Map normal network behavior and identify potential C2 communications.
  - **Visualization**: Export data using PowerShell and create a network graph with D3.js.

### System Log Deep Dive

- **Event ID 7045: A Service Was Installed in the System**
  - **Importance**: Detect persistence mechanisms by tracking services installed by unusual processes.
  - **Advanced Detection**: Correlate with Process Creation events (4688).

### Application Log Exploration

- **Event ID 1102: Audit Log Cleared**
  - **Importance**: Detect attempts to cover tracks.
  - **Response**: Set up an alert for immediate notification when this event occurs.

### Custom Log Views and Correlation

Create custom views that correlate events across different logs to detect complex threats.

**PowerShell Script to Create a Custom View**:
```powershell
$xmlFilter = @"
<QueryList>
  <Query Id="0" Path="Security">
    <Select Path="Security">*[System[(EventID=4625)]]</Select>
  </Query>
  <Query Id="1" Path="Microsoft-Windows-Windows Firewall With Advanced Security/Firewall">
    <Select Path="Microsoft-Windows-Windows Firewall With Advanced Security/Firewall">*</Select>
  </Query>
</QueryList>
"@
New-EventLog -LogName "CustomSecurityView" -Source "CorrelatedEvents"
$xmlFilter | Out-File "C:\CustomViews\BruteForceDetection.xml"
```

## Harnessing Sysmon for Deep System Visibility <a name="harnessing-sysmon-for-deep-system-visibility"></a>

Sysmon offers unparalleled insight into system activity, enabling threat detection before damage occurs.

### Best Practices for Sysmon Configuration

- **Use a comprehensive configuration file** to filter noise and focus on critical events.
- **Log key activities** such as process creation, network connections, and driver loads.
- **Regularly update the configuration** to stay ahead of new threats.

### Sysmon Event Correlation

Correlate Sysmon events with traditional Windows Event Logs:

- **Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Creation)** combined with **Security Event ID 4688** to validate process legitimacy.
- **Sysmon Event ID 3 (Network Connection)** correlated with **Firewall logs** to detect unauthorized data exfiltration.

### Automating Response with Sysmon

Automate responses to Sysmon events with scripts.

**Example PowerShell Script**:
```powershell
$sysmonEvent = Get-WinEvent -LogName "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" -MaxEvents 1 | Where-Object { $_.Id -eq 1 }
$processPath = $sysmonEvent.Properties[5].Value
If ($processPath -match "C:\SuspiciousFolder") {
    Stop-Process -Name $sysmonEvent.Properties[6].Value
    New-Item -Path "C:\Quarantine" -Name "$($sysmonEvent.Properties[6].Value).bak" -ItemType File
    Move-Item -Path $processPath -Destination "C:\Quarantine\"
}
```

## Leveraging Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) <a name="leveraging-event-tracing-for-windows"></a>

ETW provides customizable insights into system performance and activity, making it indispensable for advanced threat detection.

### Setting Up ETW for Security Monitoring

- **Select appropriate providers**: Focus on providers generating security-related events.
- **Control trace sessions**: Use tools like `logman` to manage trace sessions.
- **Analyze trace data**: Use Windows Performance Analyzer or custom scripts for interpretation.

### ETW Use Cases

- **Detecting Rootkits**: Monitor low-level kernel events.
- **Advanced Persistence Detection**: Trace system boot and service startup events.

**Example ETW Session Start**:
```powershell
logman start My

Trace -p {e02b9d16-d873-4a5c-9f8d-7c24ff37b8ff} -o C:\Logs\MyTrace.etl -ets
```

### Analyzing ETW Data

- **ETW to SIEM**: Integrate ETW data with SIEM solutions for comprehensive threat visibility.
- **Custom Dashboards**: Create custom dashboards in Power BI or ELK Stack for real-time analysis.

**Example Visualization**:
